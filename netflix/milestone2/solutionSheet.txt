Problem2:

(a) 
# command line: spark-submit --master local[*] Desktop/netflix/milestone2/problem_a.py -input_path file:/home/cloudera/Desktop/netflix/netflix_subset/TestingRatings.txt

distinct users: 27555; distinct movies: 1701

(b) We randomly picked 10 users/items
user-user: 
take 10 users from test dataset, the estimated average overlap of items for users is 9475

item-item:
take 10 movies from test dataset, the estimated average overlap of users for items is 335 

(c)
We are going to use item-item and the reasons are as follows.
efficiency: there are fewer movies than users, so the time complexity of the algorithm will be smaller.
quality: from (b), we can find that item-item generates less overlapping. That's because items usually 
    belong to a small set of 'genre' compared to user's various tastes. So we think item similarity is more meaningful than user similarity.

(d) we decide to use normalization

genre
more users

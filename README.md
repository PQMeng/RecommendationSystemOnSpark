This repo was for building scalable recommendation systems, currently containing:

- item-item based collaborative filtering algorithms on Netflix dataset
- alternating least squares algorithms on Movielens dataset

These projects were both deployed on AWS Elastic MapReduce (EMR) to improve their scalability. Feedback and contribution are welcome.
